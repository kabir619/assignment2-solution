                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>
                  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. Fun fact; CERN ejected the ideas of HTML at the first go.

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
